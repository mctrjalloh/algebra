Symbolic Algebraic Calculator in Python
========================

This project is about solving algebraic expressions step by step as we do in math school class, but automatically!

e.g. what if you write:

2*(3 + 4)

and then ask the software to reduce this expression, step by step..
it would do this:

2*(3 + 4)
2 * 7
14

you get the idea.

It also let you do many other operations like: develope, factorize, etc
