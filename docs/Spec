Problem: solving polynomial equations: e.g: 2x + 3 = 0
Solution:
    Action: multiply 2 by 1
    Observation : (2, 3)
    Reward: 2 + 3 = 6 => r = -6

    Action: multiply 2 by random number (let's say -2)
    Observation: (2*-2, 3) = (-4, 3)
    Reward: -4 + 3 = -1 => r = -1

    ...
    ...
    ...

    Action: multiply 2 by -1.5
    Observation: (-3, 3)
    Reward: -3 + 3 = 0 => r = 0
